    <span>1. Control Flow</span>
</h2>
<p class="description">
    Control flow refers to the sequence in which individual statements, instructions, or function calls are executed or evaluated in a program. In Python, control flow enables developers to manage how the program processes data and responds to user inputs or external conditions. 
    <br><br>
    Control flow is crucial for building logical, interactive, and dynamic programs. It allows you to implement decision-making, iteration, and branching. Without control flow, programs would execute all instructions sequentially, limiting functionality. Common control flow constructs include <strong>conditional statements</strong>, <strong>loops</strong>, and <strong>function calls</strong>.
    <br><br>
    Python provides highly intuitive constructs for control flow, enabling developers to write clean, readable, and maintainable code. These constructs support a wide range of applications, from simple scripts to complex systems.

    <span>2. Conditional Statements</span>
</h2>
<p class="description">
    Conditional statements form the backbone of decision-making in Python programs. By evaluating conditions that return `True` or `False`, you can direct the flow of the program to execute specific blocks of code based on the outcome. 
    <br><br>
    Conditions can be as simple as checking whether a number is positive or negative, or as complex as verifying multiple conditions involving user input, data from APIs, or sensor readings. Python supports logical operators like `and`, `or`, and `not`, enabling you to combine multiple conditions for more sophisticated decision-making.
    <br><br>
    The syntax of conditional statements in Python is designed to be straightforward and beginner-friendly. Unlike other programming languages, Python uses indentation to define the scope of the conditional block, making the code highly readable and intuitive.

    <span>3. If, Else, and Elif Statements</span>
</h2>
<p class="description">
    The `if`, `else`, and `elif` statements are foundational constructs for implementing branching logic in Python. These statements allow you to build programs that respond dynamically to different inputs or states:
    <br><br>
    <strong>If</strong>: The `if` statement is used to execute a block of code only when a specified condition is true. For example:
    <pre class="code-block">
    if temperature > 30:
        print("It's a hot day!")
    </pre>
    <strong>Else</strong>: The `else` statement provides an alternative block of code that executes if the `if` condition evaluates to false. For instance:
    <pre class="code-block">
    if temperature > 30:
        print("It's a hot day!")
    else:
        print("The weather is moderate.")
    </pre>
    <strong>Elif</strong>: Short for "else if," the `elif` statement allows you to check additional conditions when the initial `if` condition is false. You can chain multiple `elif` statements to handle complex scenarios:
    <pre class="code-block">
    if temperature > 30:
        print("It's a hot day!")
    elif temperature < 10:
        print("It's a cold day!")
    else:
        print("The weather is mild.")
    </pre>
    These constructs are essential for building programs that need to adapt to various inputs and situations.

    <span>4. Logical Operators</span>
</h2>
<p class="description">
    Logical operators are critical for combining multiple conditions in Python. They enable you to write expressive and concise code for scenarios that depend on complex conditions:
    <br><br>
    <strong>And</strong>: Returns `True` if both conditions are true. For example:
    <pre class="code-block">
    if age > 18 and has_voter_id:
        print("You are eligible to vote.")
    </pre>
    <strong>Or</strong>: Returns `True` if at least one of the conditions is true. Example:
    <pre class="code-block">
    if age > 18 or has_voter_id:
        print("You might be eligible to vote.")
    </pre>
    <strong>Not</strong>: Negates the condition, returning `True` if the condition is false. Example:
    <pre class="code-block">
    if not is_logged_in:
        print("Please log in to continue.")
    </pre>
    Logical operators are especially useful in scenarios requiring multiple checks, such as access control, validation, and decision-making.

    <span>5. Example Code</span>
</h2>
<p class="description">
    Below is an example that demonstrates how conditional statements and logical operators can be combined to handle real-world scenarios:
</p>

<pre class="code-block">
# Example: Travel Recommendations Based on Age
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

if age < 18:
    print("You are a minor. We recommend family-friendly destinations!")
elif 18 <= age < 30:
    print("You might enjoy adventure trips and solo travel experiences!")
elif 30 <= age < 60:
    print("Consider relaxing vacation spots and cultural tours!")
else:
    print("Explore senior-friendly destinations with comfortable amenities!")

# Logical operator example: Discount Eligibility
is_student = True
purchase_amount = 250

if is_student and purchase_amount > 200:
    print("You qualify for a special student discount!")
elif is_student or purchase_amount > 200:
    print("You qualify for a regular discount!")
else:
    print("No discount available.")
</pre>

</h2>
<p class="description">
    Conditional statements are widely used in various fields and applications:
    <br><br>
    <strong>Web Development</strong>: Control access to resources or features based on user roles. For example, only admins can access certain sections of a website.
    <br>
    <strong>Data Analysis</strong>: Filter rows in a dataset based on specific criteria, such as selecting rows where sales exceed a certain threshold.
    <br>
    <strong>Gaming</strong>: Implement game mechanics like scoring, level progression, and win/lose conditions based on player actions.
    <br>
    <strong>E-Commerce</strong>: Determine product recommendations or discounts based on user behavior and purchase history.
    <br>
    <strong>Automation</strong>: Trigger specific actions, such as sending notifications or updating logs, when predefined conditions are met in IoT systems or server monitoring.
