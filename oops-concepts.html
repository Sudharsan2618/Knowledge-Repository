    <span>1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</span>
</h2>
<p class="description">
    Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes to model real-world concepts. In OOP, data and behavior are encapsulated into classes, and objects are instances of these classes. OOP allows for greater modularity, reusability, and maintainability of code, making it ideal for larger, more complex programs.
    <br><br>
    Key concepts in OOP include **classes**, **objects**, **methods**, **constructors**, **inheritance**, **encapsulation**, and **polymorphism**. Python is an object-oriented programming language, which means that it supports all the essential principles of OOP, allowing developers to create structured and reusable code.
    <br><br>
    In OOP, classes define the blueprint for creating objects, and objects represent instances of those classes. This enables the programmer to model the program structure more naturally, resembling the behavior and attributes of real-world entities.

<h2 class="section-heading" id="classes-and-objects">
    <span>2. Classes and Objects</span>
</h2>
<p class="description">
    A class in Python serves as a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes (data) and methods (functions) that can be applied to instances of the class (objects). Objects are instances of a class that hold data specific to that instance and can call the classâ€™s methods to perform actions.
    <br><br>
    - **Classes**: A class defines the structure and behavior of an object. It is essentially a template that outlines the data and actions (methods) an object will have.
    - **Objects**: An object is an instantiation of a class. It is a specific instance with its own data (attributes) and can use the class methods.
    <br><br>
    The key to object-oriented design is that classes act as blueprints, and objects are the specific realizations of those blueprints. Objects can communicate with each other by calling methods and passing data.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading" id="constructors">
    <span>3. Constructors</span>
</h2>
<p class="description">
    A constructor is a special method that is called when an object is instantiated. It initializes the object's attributes and sets up any necessary state. In Python, the constructor is defined using the `__init__` method.
    <br><br>
    The constructor method allows you to initialize an object with certain default values or user-supplied arguments when the object is created. 
    <br><br>
    Example:
    <pre class="code-block">
    class Car:
        def __init__(self, brand, model, year):
            self.brand = brand
            self.model = model
            self.year = year

    my_car = Car("Toyota", "Corolla", 2020)
    print(my_car.brand)  # Output: Toyota
    print(my_car.model)  # Output: Corolla
    print(my_car.year)   # Output: 2020
    </pre>
    In the above example, the `__init__` method initializes the `Car` class with `brand`, `model`, and `year` attributes, which are assigned when the object is created.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading" id="methods">
    <span>4. Methods</span>
</h2>
<p class="description">
    Methods are functions that are defined within a class and are used to perform actions on an object's data. Methods can access and modify an object's attributes and perform operations using those attributes. They are an essential component of OOP, allowing objects to interact with their data and the world around them.
    <br><br>
    There are two main types of methods in Python:
    - **Instance methods**: These are the most common and operate on an instance of the class. They take the instance itself (typically `self`) as the first parameter.
    - **Class methods**: These are used for operations that involve the class itself, not specific instances, and are defined with a `cls` parameter.
    <br><br>
    Example:
    <pre class="code-block">
    class Car:
        def __init__(self, brand, model, year):
            self.brand = brand
            self.model = model
            self.year = year

        def start_engine(self):
            print(f"The {self.brand} {self.model}'s engine is now running.")

    my_car = Car("Toyota", "Corolla", 2020)
    my_car.start_engine()  # Output: The Toyota Corolla's engine is now running.
    </pre>
    The `start_engine` method is an instance method that performs an action on the object's data.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading" id="inheritance">
    <span>5. Inheritance</span>
</h2>
<p class="description">
    Inheritance is one of the fundamental principles of OOP, allowing one class (the child class) to inherit the attributes and methods of another class (the parent class). This promotes code reuse and establishes a relationship between the child and parent classes.
    <br><br>
    A child class can add its own methods and attributes, while still inheriting the behavior of the parent class. This makes inheritance an essential tool for building hierarchical relationships between classes.
    <br><br>
    Example:
    <pre class="code-block">
    class Vehicle:
        def __init__(self, brand, model):
            self.brand = brand
            self.model = model

        def start_engine(self):
            print(f"The {self.brand} {self.model}'s engine is starting.")

    class Car(Vehicle):
        def __init__(self, brand, model, doors):
            super().__init__(brand, model)
            self.doors = doors

        def honk(self):
            print(f"The {self.brand} {self.model} is honking!")

    my_car = Car("Honda", "Civic", 4)
    my_car.start_engine()  # Inherited from Vehicle
    my_car.honk()  # Specific to Car
    </pre>
    In the example, the `Car` class inherits from the `Vehicle` class, meaning it can use the `start_engine` method from `Vehicle` while adding its own `honk` method.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading" id="encapsulation">
    <span>6. Encapsulation</span>
</h2>
<p class="description">
    Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit, or class. It is also used to restrict access to certain attributes and methods to prevent accidental modification of data.
    <br><br>
    Python achieves encapsulation through access control modifiers. While Python doesn't have strict access control like some other languages, it uses naming conventions to indicate the visibility of an attribute or method:
    - **Public**: Accessible from outside the class (e.g., `self.attribute`).
    - **Protected**: Intended for internal use by the class and its subclasses (e.g., `_attribute`).
    - **Private**: Intended to be hidden from outside access (e.g., `__attribute`).
    <br><br>
    Example:
    <pre class="code-block">
    class BankAccount:
        def __init__(self, balance):
            self.__balance = balance  # Private attribute

        def deposit(self, amount):
            if amount > 0:
                self.__balance += amount
                print(f"Deposited: ${amount}")

        def get_balance(self):
            return self.__balance

    account = BankAccount(1000)
    account.deposit(500)
    print(account.get_balance())  # Output: 1500
    </pre>
    In this example, the `__balance` attribute is private, and it can only be accessed or modified through the `deposit` and `get_balance` methods.
</p>

    <span>7. Real-World Scenarios</span>
</h2>
<p class="description">
    Object-Oriented Programming is widely used in various domains to solve complex problems and build scalable software systems:
    <br><br>
    - **Web Development**: OOP is used in frameworks like Django and Flask to manage models (representing entities like users and products) and views (handling user interactions).
    <br>
    - **Game Development**: In games, OOP is used to model entities such as players, enemies, and obstacles, each with their own properties and behaviors.
    <br>
    - **Enterprise Software**: Large-scale systems like banking applications, CRM systems, and e-commerce platforms rely on OOP principles to ensure scalability, maintainability, and flexibility.
    <br>
    - **GUI Applications**: GUI frameworks like Tkinter or PyQt use OOP to represent components such as buttons, text boxes, and windows as objects with attributes and methods.
