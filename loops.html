    <span>1. Loops</span>
</h2>
<p class="description">
    In programming, **loops** are control flow constructs that allow a sequence of instructions to be executed repeatedly based on a condition. Loops are indispensable for automating repetitive tasks, iterating over data structures, and processing datasets. 
    <br><br>
    Python offers two primary looping mechanisms:
    <br>
    - **For Loop**: Iterates over a sequence such as a list, tuple, string, or range.
    - **While Loop**: Executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is `True`.
    <br><br>
    Loops significantly reduce the need for duplicate code, making your programs more efficient, concise, and easier to maintain. Whether you're building a data pipeline, designing a game, or automating reports, loops are a vital tool in your programming arsenal.

<h2 class="section-heading" id="for-loop">
    <span>2. For Loop</span>
</h2>
<p class="description">
    The **for loop** in Python is used to iterate over a sequence of elements, such as lists, tuples, strings, or ranges. It automatically retrieves each element from the sequence and executes the block of code for each iteration. 
    <br><br>
    Syntax:
    <pre class="code-block">
    for variable in sequence:
        # Code block to execute
    </pre>
    The `for` loop is especially useful when you know the number of iterations beforehand or when working with iterable objects. Here are some examples:
    <pre class="code-block">
    # Example: Iterating over a list
    fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
    for fruit in fruits:
        print(fruit)

    # Example: Iterating over a range
    for i in range(5):
        print(f"The value is: {i}")
    </pre>
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading" id="while-loop">
    <span>3. While Loop</span>
</h2>
<p class="description">
    The **while loop** executes a block of code as long as a given condition evaluates to `True`. It is typically used when the number of iterations is not predetermined but depends on runtime conditions.
    <br><br>
    Syntax:
    <pre class="code-block">
    while condition:
        # Code block to execute
    </pre>
    Example:
    <pre class="code-block">
    # Example: Counting down from 5
    count = 5
    while count > 0:
        print(count)
        count -= 1
    </pre>
    Be cautious when using `while` loops to avoid infinite loops. Ensure that the condition eventually becomes `False`.

<h2 class="section-heading" id="iterating-over-structures">
    <span>4. Iterating Over Structures</span>
</h2>
<p class="description">
    Python loops make it simple to iterate over different data structures:
    <br><br>
    - **Lists**: Process each element in a list:
    <pre class="code-block">
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    for num in numbers:
        print(num)
    </pre>
    - **Strings**: Iterate over each character in a string:
    <pre class="code-block">
    text = "hello"
    for char in text:
        print(char)
    </pre>
    - **Dictionaries**: Iterate over keys, values, or both:
    <pre class="code-block">
    data = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}
    for key, value in data.items():
        print(f"{key}: {value}")
    </pre>
    - **Ranges**: Use the `range()` function to generate sequences of numbers:
    <pre class="code-block">
    for i in range(1, 11):
        print(i * i)  # Print squares of numbers 1-10
    </pre>
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading" id="nested-loops">
    <span>5. Nested Loops</span>
</h2>
<p class="description">
    **Nested loops** involve having one loop inside another. These are useful for tasks involving multidimensional data, such as processing matrices or performing comparisons.
    <pre class="code-block">
    # Example: Multiplication Table
    for i in range(1, 6):
        for j in range(1, 6):
            print(i * j, end=" ")
        print()  # Newline after each row
    </pre>
    While nested loops are powerful, use them judiciously to avoid excessive complexity and performance issues in large datasets.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading" id="break-continue-pass">
    <span>6. Break, Continue, and Pass</span>
</h2>
<p class="description">
    Python provides control flow keywords to fine-tune the behavior of loops:
    <br><br>
    - **Break**: Exits the loop entirely:
    <pre class="code-block">
    for num in range(10):
        if num == 5:
            break
        print(num)
    </pre>
    - **Continue**: Skips the current iteration and moves to the next:
    <pre class="code-block">
    for num in range(10):
        if num % 2 == 0:
            continue
        print(num)  # Prints only odd numbers
    </pre>
    - **Pass**: Does nothing; acts as a placeholder:
    <pre class="code-block">
    for num in range(5):
        if num == 2:
            pass  # Placeholder for future logic
        print(num)
    </pre>
</p>

</h2>
<p class="description">
    Loops are used extensively in various applications:
    <br><br>
    - **Data Processing**: Iterating through large datasets for cleaning, transformation, or analysis.
    <br>
    - **Web Scraping**: Extracting data from web pages by iterating over multiple URLs or elements.
    <br>
    - **Gaming**: Implementing game loops to manage player input, update game states, and render graphics.
    <br>
    - **Automation**: Repeating tasks like sending emails, processing files, or monitoring server logs.
    <br>
    - **Machine Learning**: Iterating over training data to optimize models or evaluate performance.
