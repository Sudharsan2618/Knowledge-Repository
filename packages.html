    <span>1. Libraries & Frameworks</span>
</h2>
<p class="description">
    Libraries and frameworks in Python are essential tools that extend the core functionality of the language. They provide pre-built functions and classes that help developers save time, reduce errors, and improve productivity. A library is a collection of modules that offer specific functionality, while a framework provides a more structured foundation for building applications.
    <br><br>
    Python has a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks for a wide range of applications, including web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more. Among these, **NumPy** and **Pandas** stand out for their powerful capabilities in data manipulation and analysis. These libraries are widely used in data science and machine learning for handling and analyzing large datasets efficiently.

    <span>2. NumPy & Pandas</span>
</h2>
<p class="description">
    **NumPy** (Numerical Python) and **Pandas** are two of the most popular libraries for data manipulation and analysis in Python. While NumPy focuses on numerical computing with arrays and matrices, Pandas excels in handling and analyzing data in tabular form, making it indispensable for data analysis tasks.
    <br><br>
    - **NumPy**: Primarily used for numerical operations, NumPy provides a powerful n-dimensional array object (ndarray) and offers a wide range of functions for mathematical, logical, and statistical operations. NumPy arrays are faster and more memory-efficient than regular Python lists, making them ideal for numerical computations.
    <br><br>
    - **Pandas**: Built on top of NumPy, Pandas provides high-level data structures such as **Series** (1-dimensional) and **DataFrame** (2-dimensional). Pandas makes it easy to work with structured data by allowing operations like data cleaning, merging, reshaping, and aggregation. It is particularly useful for tasks that involve time-series data, CSV files, and SQL-like operations.

    <span>3. NumPy Arrays</span>
</h2>
<p class="description">
    NumPy arrays are the core data structure in NumPy. They are more efficient than Python lists and provide better performance for numerical operations. NumPy arrays allow you to perform element-wise operations and matrix manipulations with minimal code.
    <br><br>
    NumPy arrays can be created from Python lists or tuples. The array's elements must be of the same data type, unlike Python lists which can store elements of mixed types. Here's an example of creating and manipulating NumPy arrays:
</p>

<pre class="code-block">
import numpy as np

# Create a 1D NumPy array
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Element-wise operations
arr_squared = arr ** 2
print("Squared array:", arr_squared)

# Create a 2D NumPy array (matrix)
matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
print("Matrix:")
print(matrix)

# Matrix multiplication
result = np.dot(matrix, matrix.T)  # Dot product with its transpose
print("Matrix multiplication result:")
print(result)
</pre>
<p class="description">
    In the example above, the array `arr` is squared element-wise, and a 2D matrix `matrix` is created for matrix multiplication. These operations are fast and efficient, which is why NumPy is favored for numerical computations in fields like machine learning and scientific computing.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading" id="pandas-dataframe">
    <span>4. Pandas DataFrame</span>
</h2>
<p class="description">
    The **DataFrame** is the primary data structure in Pandas. It is a 2D table with rows and columns, much like a database table or an Excel spreadsheet. DataFrames are ideal for handling structured data and performing operations like filtering, grouping, and aggregating.
    <br><br>
    DataFrames are flexible and allow various operations such as indexing, slicing, and reshaping. You can easily read data from CSV files, SQL databases, and even JSON. Here's an example of creating and working with a DataFrame:
</p>

<pre class="code-block">
import pandas as pd

# Create a DataFrame from a dictionary
data = {'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David'],
        'Age': [24, 27, 22, 32],
        'Score': [85, 92, 78, 88]}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print("DataFrame:")
print(df)

# Filter data: Select rows where Age is greater than 25
filtered_df = df[df['Age'] > 25]
print("Filtered DataFrame (Age > 25):")
print(filtered_df)

# Calculate mean score
mean_score = df['Score'].mean()
print("Average Score:", mean_score)
</pre>
<p class="description">
    In this example, we create a DataFrame `df` from a dictionary, filter the rows based on the condition (`Age > 25`), and calculate the mean of the `Score` column. These are common operations when analyzing datasets in real-world applications.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading" id="real-world-scenarios">
    <span>5. Real-World Scenarios</span>
</h2>
<p class="description">
    Both NumPy and Pandas are indispensable for data science, machine learning, and other data-heavy applications. Here are some real-world scenarios where these libraries are frequently used:
    <br><br>
    - **Data Analysis**: Analysts use Pandas to load, clean, and manipulate large datasets. They can filter data, aggregate it, and perform calculations such as averages, totals, and percentages. NumPy helps with handling the numerical calculations on large arrays efficiently.
    <br>
    - **Machine Learning**: Data scientists use NumPy to preprocess data, handle large datasets, and perform matrix operations for training machine learning models. Pandas is used to manipulate data before feeding it into machine learning algorithms.
    <br>
    - **Finance**: In finance, Pandas is used for time series analysis, allowing analysts to work with stock market data, calculate moving averages, and perform financial modeling. NumPy is used for optimizing portfolio management and calculating returns.
    <br>
    - **Healthcare**: NumPy and Pandas are used for processing medical data, from analyzing patient records to modeling genetic data. Researchers use these libraries for performing statistical operations and visualizing trends in health data.

<p class="description">
    Both NumPy and Pandas come with a wide range of built-in functions that streamline the process of data manipulation and analysis. Here are some commonly used functions:
    <br><br>
    - **NumPy Functions**:
        - `np.mean()`: Calculates the mean of an array.
