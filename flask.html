    <span>1. Introduction to Flask</span>
</h2>
<p class="description">
    Flask is a lightweight web framework for Python that is used to build web applications quickly and with minimal code. It is classified as a microframework because it doesn't require a particular tool or library, allowing the developer to choose the components they need. Flask provides the basic tools to get a web server running, but it can also be extended with numerous plugins and libraries.
    <br><br>
    Flask is well-suited for both small-scale applications, like personal blogs or APIs, and large-scale applications that require modularity and flexibility. It’s favored by many developers due to its simplicity, scalability, and the control it provides over your web application’s structure.
    <br><br>
    In this section, we'll dive into the core features of Flask, such as routing, templates, and forms, that make it an excellent choice for building web applications.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading" id="flask-routing">
    <span>2. Flask Routing</span>
</h2>
<p class="description">
    Routing in Flask is how the framework determines which view function should be executed based on the URL requested by the user. When you define a route, Flask maps it to a specific Python function, known as a **view function**, which is executed when that route is accessed.
    <br><br>
    Routes are defined using the `@app.route` decorator, followed by the URL pattern. When a user visits the route, the corresponding function is executed. Routes can also accept dynamic segments, making it possible to handle variables in the URL.
    <br><br>
    Flask's routing mechanism is flexible, allowing for easy creation of RESTful APIs, handling user requests, and creating complex routing logic as needed. Below is an example:
</p>

<pre class="code-block">
# Example: Flask Route Definition
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return "Welcome to the Flask home page!"

@app.route('/about')
def about():
    return "This is the about page."

@app.route('/user/<username>')
def user_profile(username):
    return f"Hello, {username}!"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
</pre>

<p class="description">
    In the above example, we have defined three routes:
    - The root (`/`) route renders a welcome message.
    - The `/about` route displays information about the site.
    - The `/user/<username>` route accepts a dynamic variable `<username>` that is passed to the view function and displayed in the message.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading" id="flask-templates">
    <span>3. Flask Templates</span>
</h2>
<p class="description">
    Flask uses **Jinja2** as its default template engine, which allows you to generate dynamic HTML pages. Templates are HTML files with embedded placeholders and expressions that are filled in with data when the page is rendered. Using templates in Flask allows for cleaner, more maintainable code and separation of logic and presentation.
    <br><br>
    Templates in Flask are typically stored in a folder named `templates`, and you can render a template by using the `render_template()` function in your view functions. Here's an example demonstrating how to use templates in Flask:
</p>

<pre class="code-block">
# Example: Flask Template Rendering
from flask import Flask, render_template

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    username = "John"
    return render_template('home.html', user=username)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
</pre>

<p class="description">
    In this example, the `render_template()` function renders an HTML file called `home.html` and passes a variable `user` to the template. The template might look like this:
</p>

<pre class="code-block">
<!-- home.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Flask Template Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome, {{ user }}!</h1>
</body>
</html>
</pre>

<p class="description">
    The `{{ user }}` in the template is a Jinja2 expression that will be replaced with the value of the `user` variable passed from the route. This is just one of many features provided by Jinja2, such as conditionals, loops, and template inheritance, which make it a powerful tool for building dynamic web pages.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading" id="flask-forms">
    <span>4. Flask Forms</span>
</h2>
<p class="description">
    Forms are an essential part of most web applications, as they allow users to submit data. Flask makes working with forms easy, either through the use of simple HTML forms or more powerful tools like **WTForms**. Flask-WTForms is an extension for Flask that provides a form-handling toolkit with features such as form validation, field types, and CSRF protection.
    <br><br>
    Below is an example of how you can create a simple form in Flask using WTForms:
</p>

<pre class="code-block">
# Example: Flask Form Handling with WTForms
from flask import Flask, render_template, request
from flask_wtf import FlaskForm
from wtforms import StringField, SubmitField
from wtforms.validators import DataRequired

app = Flask(__name__)
app.secret_key = 'your_secret_key'

class NameForm(FlaskForm):
    name = StringField('Name', validators=[DataRequired()])
    submit = SubmitField('Submit')

@app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def home():
    form = NameForm()
    if form.validate_on_submit():
        return f"Hello, {form.name.data}!"
    return render_template('form.html', form=form)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
</pre>

<p class="description">
    In this example:
    - We define a `NameForm` class using WTForms, which includes a field for entering the user's name and a submit button.
    - The `home()` function handles both GET and POST requests. If the form is submitted and validated, it displays a greeting message.
    - The template `form.html` would look like this:
</p>

<pre class="code-block">
<!-- form.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Flask Form Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Enter your name:</h1>
    <form method="POST">
        {{ form.hidden_tag() }}
        {{ form.name.label }} {{ form.name() }}<br>
        {{ form.submit() }}
    </form>
</body>
</html>
</pre>

<h2 class="section-heading" id="flask-real-world-scenarios">
    <span>5. Real-World Scenarios Using Flask</span>
</h2>
<p class="description">
    Flask is widely used in many different industries and applications due to its flexibility and simplicity. Here are a few examples of how Flask can be applied in the real world:
    <br><br>
    - **Web APIs**: Flask is a great tool for creating RESTful APIs. It allows developers to create lightweight APIs that are easy to extend and maintain.
    <br>
    - **Content Management Systems (CMS)**: Many custom CMS platforms are built using Flask, as it allows developers to build specific features that may not be available in traditional CMS systems.
    <br>
    - **E-Commerce Sites**: Flask can be used to develop e-commerce platforms with payment integration, inventory management, and product recommendations.
    <br>
    - **Dashboard Applications**: Flask is often used to create real-time data dashboards for monitoring and displaying metrics from various sources.
    <br>
    - **Machine Learning Integration**: Flask is frequently used in machine learning applications to deploy models as web services, making it easy to interact with predictive models over the web.
